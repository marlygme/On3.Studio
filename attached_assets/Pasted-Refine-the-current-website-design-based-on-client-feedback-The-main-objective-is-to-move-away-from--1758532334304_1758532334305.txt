Refine the current website design based on client feedback. The main objective is to move away from the "corporate" feel on the desktop version and inject a more creative, unique, and abstract UI inspired by changebycole.com and marlyg.me. We also need to fix critical typography issues and update content.

1. Fix Typography and Spacing (Legibility):

Problem: As seen in the provided screenshot, text in the "Contact Information" and "How It Works" sections is squished and difficult to read.

Action: Increase the vertical spacing (margin or padding) between list items and contact details. Increase the line-height for all descriptive text to improve readability. Ensure there is clear visual separation between a heading (e.g., "Plug-and-play") and its corresponding paragraph.

2. Redesign Desktop Layout & Header:

Problem: The current desktop layout is a single, centered column which feels too corporate and generic.

Action (Layout):

Abandon the single-column structure for main content. Implement an asymmetrical, multi-column grid.

For example, a section could have its main heading in a narrow left column, with the body text and other elements in a wider right column. This will immediately create a more dynamic feel.

Action (Header):

Make the desktop header more distinctive. Try an alternative layout, such as centering the "ON3" logo and splitting the navigation links on either side of it. Add a more expressive hover effect to the navigation links.

3. Inject Creativity into Page Sections:

Problem: The "About Us," "Workshops," and individual "Space" pages are visually bland. They need a unique UI.

Action ("About Us"):

Redesign this section using a two-column layout. Place a large, stylized pull-quote on one side (e.g., "A home away from home for artists...") and the main paragraph on the other. Overlap a subtle, moody background image behind one of the columns to create depth.

Action ("Spaces" & "Workshops" Pages):

Implement a split-screen layout. On one side of the screen, display a large, high-quality image of the specific studio space (e.g., the recording studio). This image should remain "sticky" as the user scrolls.

On the other side, list the details, equipment, and information, allowing the user to scroll through the text while the image remains in view. This creates a much more engaging and less static experience.

4. Minor Content Fix:

Address Update: Please change the location/address listed on the website to the correct one: 325 Victoria St, Brunswick VIC 3056.
